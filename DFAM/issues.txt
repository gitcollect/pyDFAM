The upper and lower bar of Android hide correctly, but the title and the black spaces (I suppose from the app) do not dissapear. I tried:
1) Restarting the app.
2) Restarting the phone.
3) Disabling fullscreen, loading the novel, and reactivating fullscreen.
4) Toggle the "Invert Colors" (I didn't think that would work, but I tried it anyway.)

It worked correctly before the update.

body : Hi.

Since moving to the 11 protocol my two devices continue to sync and I verify the files are transferred, but the feedback I'm getting is odd.  I'm using Syncthing to sync my photos on my Android 5.0 device (set as Master) to an Arch linux desktop.  After a sync is complete the Android side says -103/28 Files and 685.3 MiB/685.4 MiB, and in green Idle (99%).  The desktop says my camera folder is up to date 28/28 items, but the right side has my Android device permanently displaying Syncing (100%) in blue.  Perhaps I'm not understanding what it is displaying.

The latest Syncthing v0.11.5 on both sides.

body : I've just noticed that the app uses the old image media type icon, the black one, before getting a thumbnail.

I think it would be good if the app was to use the new one and stay in sync with what's happening in core (just track the icon folder).

url : https://github.com/droolsjbpm/drools/pull/416
body : -drools-android module added
-dex classloaders for generated classes
-maven plugin for pre-serializing knowledge packages during buildtime
-roboguice extension for injecting kiebases from pre serialized packages
-Kie classpath container works.  loads compilation cache from maven build
-added drools-android-examples. one with preserialized kbases and one with classpath container

At this point the only advantage of using the preserialized kbases is that it requires lot less dependencies.  With the drools-compiler dependency I needed to use multidex to package all the classes.  Which some users might not want.. to limit the size of the apk.

-This change also depends on a change to the maven-android-plugin, to which I have already submitted a pull request.  
-Finally android 5.0 support depends on a change to mvel2, namely it's handling of the java.version system property, which cannot be overridden in android 5.0.  I am also submitting a pull request for that.

Looking forward to feedback!

url : https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/1488
body : Hello
After upgrading my project to use the latest version 3 lib, and re compile my android app
i having issues with OnOffSwitch.

I have in may app a list of selections that opens the selected from.
One of the selections is pointing to configuration form with OnOffSwitch.
The OnOffSwitch value(true/false) are set during beforeForm load.
findCmdAutoAuthenticate(f).setValue(true);

This has been working great before no issues.
But now if a set the a value to false, the form is not shown at all, and im also losing images in the selection list.
If all OnOffSwitch are set to true the form load correctly.
But if one is set to false, the form is not shown.
I get this in both the simulator and on my phone.

If i switch skin to iPhone 4, everything works ok with OnOffSwitch, but using android skin fails.
I have tried to send a build with  android.asyncPaint=false, and that didn't work.

I recreated the problem by creating an new project.
but in this case setting the OnOffSwitch to true prevented the form to load, setting it to false made show the form.
i believe its linked to the default state you have set in the GUI builder.

I see in the thread monitor that i get invokeAndBlock1 when it doesn't work.
There  is no exceptions, it feels like a infinity loop

IDE: NetBeans
Desktop OS: Windows 8.1
Simulator: Android 
Device: Galaxy note 3

To recreate the problem
you create a standard Codnameone hello project
add to the main form a OnOffSwitch via the GUI builder
The switch is now by default off.
Via the GUI builder select Events Before Show
In the netbeans code window you now have
protected void beforeMain(Form f){
}
Add to this
findOnOffSwitch(f).setValue(true)
you should now have 

protected void beforeMain(Form f){
findOnOffSwitch(f).setValue(true);
}

Run the project, using android  skin like nexus
Now you should get a blank page or no page at all.
the page dose not show the hello box and not the switch

Now change it t
findOnOffSwitch(f).setValue(false);
and run, it should now work ok.

body : After creating these folders with the GUI:
![screenshot_2015-04-18-04-00-22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10074769/7214374/f12ff0f2-e57f-11e4-9ccb-fc021346b674.png)

couldn't create add any more folders using the GUI, but managed it using the Web GUI. Did exactly like I did with the previous 3 folders: filled the fields, clicked on `CREATE`, then restarted, but the folders were not created.

Running this version from the beta [APK](http://wilma.vub.ac.be/~lhoste/private/syncthing-0.11-beta-arm-debug.apk):
![screenshot_2015-04-18-02-02-02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10074769/7214304/5a56e030-e57c-11e4-86d9-6ec5298e7831.png)
on a Motorola E XT1022 with Android 4.4.4.

Tried to debug it:

1. Set `Debug Options` to `files,events,model`, but I confess I wasn't sure which facilities were more appropriate to catch the problem
2. Tried to add this folder using the GUI:

    **Folder ID**: *sd.download*
    **Directory**: */storage/sdcard1/Download*
    **Devices**: *monk*
3. Captured the [log](http://paste.ubuntu.com/10842772/). New option `Open Log` makes this so much simpler !
4. Successfully added the folder using the Web GUI
5. Captured the [log](http://paste.ubuntu.com/10842777/)

When I first managed to create the folder using the Web GUI, I tried to delete it so that I could start from scratch with debugging, but couldn't delete it either using the GUI, although managed it with the Web GUI. In other words, **after creating those first 3 folders, couldn't add nor delete any more folders using the GUI, only using the Web GUI**.

Just to confirm, after adding `sd.download` using the Web GUI, tried to add another folder using the GUI:

**Folder ID**: *whatsapp*
**Directory**: */storage/emulated/0/WhatsApp/Media*
**Devices**: *monk*

but failed just the same, so continued adding folders using only the Web GUI.

Let me know if those debug options were appropriate to catch the problem, and whether you need me to do anything else to debug this further.

And is the Android 5.0 bug fixed in this version of the module?

body : All because I got curious (an in an effort to fully test the app), I decided to turn on https.  This happened to break the app.  I don't think there is any real big error here, the GUI just does not load anymore and syncthing crashes after a long enough time trying to load the GUI.

Either TLS needs to be supported in the interface or that setting needs to be removed on the android app.  I honestly am not sure if using TLS on the android app interface is even something that you should be able to do.
